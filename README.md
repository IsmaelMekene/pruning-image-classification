# pruning-image-classification

## Introduction

In this repository, we first deal with a simple OCR model built with the Functional API. Apart from combining CNN and RNN, it also illustrates how you can instantiate a new layer and use it as an "Endpoint layer" for implementing CTC loss. Thereafter, we implement pruned versions of the baseline model in order to evalute them.
